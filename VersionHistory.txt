version: "2018.9.11.1"
-- Description: Fixed the issue where inconsistent icons were displayed on Google Search and on Manager portal.
-- Issue: Code uses promises to display the icons. Promise.all expects all passed promises to be executed
          successfully but some promises were failing hence UpdatePhoneDetails function was not called.
-- Solution: Promise failure scenario was not actually a failure so called Promise' resolve function (which means successful)
             on failed promises as well and that fixed the issue.

version: "2018.9.20.1"
-- Description: Added a FilterURLMask which stops the Chrome Extension to run on some pages.
-- Issue: Chrome Extension blindly replaces all phone numbers with formatted number and an icon. This becomes troublesome when
          users send some SMS to prospect clients as the extension replaces the phone number with icon.
-- Solution: On the Extension's options page added a text box where the user can enter the FilterURLMask separated by pipe "|".
             Code will read it in the code and will stop the Extension from running if the current URL matches the Mask.

version: "2018.9.21.1"
--Description: Earlier added FilterURLMask for URL localsplash.com which blocked the extension on all localsplash URLs.
--Issue: Adding FilterURLMask for localsplash.com blocked the extension on URLs like manager.localspalsh.com and my.localsplash.com
--Solution: Removed the permanent FilterURLMask for URL localsplash.com and added very specific masks for URLs which we actually
            want to block.

version: "2018.10.02.1"
--Description: Added permanent FilterURLMask for Gmail.
--Issue: Email signature on Gmail was showing some garbled texts and image. It was happening because when saving the signature
         those garbled images and texts were getting saved.
--Solution: Blocked the extension on "mail.google.com" URL.

version: "2019.11.15.1"
--Description: Fixed issue where after sorting reports incorrect icons were displayed.
--Issue: After clicking on column header the data is changed by an AJAX call but new call to GetPhones endpoint is not getting made.
         This is resulting into all numbers being displayed with Green Icons which is default.
--Solution: Called Promise' resolve function which will trigger AJAX call to GetPhone endpoint with new phone numbers on the page.

version: "2019.11.26.1"

--Solution: Whitelisted them.
